This folder contains a sample deployment of a scrapeIt app using a serverless deployment to AWS Lambda. 
Note if you use the pre-built docker container, you will not need to install any additional libraries.
If you want to build your own docker container for this deployment, you should use the Dockerfile found in the scrapeit folder.
